# Workflows - Local Usage Guide

This folder defines command workflows used during development.

## Recommended order
1. `/plan`
2. `/debug` or `/enhance`
3. `/test`
4. `/deploy` (only when explicitly requested)

## Key workflows
- `orchestrate.md`: multi-agent coordination for complex tasks
- `plan.md`: produces actionable plan file before large changes
- `debug.md`: systematic root cause flow
- `test.md`: test execution and coverage validation
